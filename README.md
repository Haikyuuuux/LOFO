# Lost and Found Platform

## Project Description
A full-stack lost-and-found web application that lets users report lost or found items, browse listings, manage their profile, and upload item photos. The frontend is built with Next.js, and the backend uses Express with RESTful routes for authentication, user management, and item CRUD operations.

## Core Principle
Help people reunite with their lost belongings quickly and safely by providing a clear, trusted flow to report, browse, and claim items—with photos, details, and status updates—backed by secure auth and full CRUD APIs.

## Core Requirements

Your application must include:

1. CRUD Functionalities

Create – Insert data into the database  
Read – Display or retrieve existing data.  
Update – Edit or modify existing data.  
Delete – Remove records from the database

## Getting Started

From the `frontend` directory, start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

From the `backend` directory, start the Express API server:

```bash

npm start
```
